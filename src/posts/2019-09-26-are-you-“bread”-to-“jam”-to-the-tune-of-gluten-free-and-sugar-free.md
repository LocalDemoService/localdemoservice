Some things should just be fun: Meeting a friend for brunch, planning a camping trip, or receiving a spontaneous invitation to dinner out. For those who have to avoid gluten or sugar, these occasions can become fraught with stress and awkwardness, as they can't take for granted what most of us can. And many people are not merely looking for the lack of gluten or sugar, but the presence of nutrition.

The gluten-free landscape is much brighter than it was a few years ago. Grocery stores have entire gluten-free sections, and many restaurants can accommodate gluten-free without compromising the culinary experience. Most people cannot tell the difference between traditional wheat-based baked goods and their higher quality gluten-free counterparts. Sugar-free options are on the rise, as well, and the appropriate stigma surrounding synthetic sweeteners, like aspartame and saccharin, is spreading. The diabetic and ketogenic market demands nutritious alternatives! 

There are a few emerging companies that are not just offering tasty substitutes to gluten and sugar, but also building customers health by raising the bar for quality ingredients. Two brands on the forefront of this movement include [Happy Campers Ancient-Grain Breads](https://www.happycampersgf.com/), and [Nature's Hollow Sugar-Free Jams](https://www.natureshollow.com/). These two brands utilize nutrient dense ingredients, without fillers or preservatives. 

Happy Campers utilizes less hybridized ancient grains such as millet, sorghum, buckwheat, amaranth. These varieties are higher in protein, and are much easier for our bodies to assimilate and metabolize. Classy Slice, Hemp Hemp Hooray, Stompin' Good Seedy Buckwheat Molasses are just a few of their varieties you can [order online](https://www.happycampersgf.com/shop/). This brand produces bread for any occasion, however, HCGF is best enjoyed toasted; revealing the soft texture and rich flavors that their healthy-bread has to offer. They pair greatly with any sandwich, which most gluten-free breads cannot boast.

If you are looking to drop your sugar intake, pair Happy Campers Bread with Nature's Hollow Jams. Raspberry, Blueberry, Apricot, and our favorite, Mountain Berry, are all sugar-free  varieties offered by Nature’s Hollow. Customers may not realize how much sugar is added to their favorite jam or jelly - 8g, 10g or even 12g of added sugars per tablespoon serving. That’s a lot! Daily sugar intake can add up quickly with numbers like these. The folks at Nature’s Hollow understand this problem. All their jams are foremost fruit focused and sweetened with a proprietary blend of xylitol and erythritol to round off the sweetness. Our samplers were astonished that the jams were sugar-free because there is no strange aftertaste or flavor differences. Just a whole-fruit taste without the extra calories and carbs. Besides being a perfect alternative for diabetics and folks on a ketogenic diet, xylitol and erythritol are beneficial to diet conscious fitness enthusiasts and clean eaters​. Lastly, Nature’s Hollow makes a great option for topping pancakes, waffles, or your favorite dessert. Nature's Hollow Spreads  should be on your next shopping list! 

You can find these brands in [Huckleberry’s Market](https://www.huckleberrysnaturalmarket.com/), [Natural Grocers](https://www.naturalgrocers.com/), and many other grocery chains across the Pacific North-West.
