The excitement was high when we received samples in the mail of Jajja Wellness Tonics and Shots! We originally met Henry, the Founder of [Jajja Wellness Tonics](https://jajjawellness.com/), on Oahu in 2016. This was before launching Local Demo Service, when we were originally known as Hawaiian Marketing and Demo Services. At this time we ran farmers markets, did product demonstrations, and offered social media shoutouts to locally grown hawaiian brands, such as Jajja Wellness Tonics. This is where we were first introduced to Jajja Wellness Tonics’s delicious and cleansing beverages, at the farmers markets on Oahu. Over the years both of our companies have moved their headquarters to the mainland; where Jajja Wellness Tonics is now stationed in Minnesota. Using recipes from the Founder’s Ugandan grandmother, Jajja Wellness Tonics packs Organic Superfoods into every bottle, helping consumers to boost immunity, detox, increase energy levels, and enjoy overall wellness. Jajja Wellness Tonics is not only healthy and delectable in flavor, but it is a much more environmentally friendly product bottled in glass, with ingredients free of non-organic pesticides, herbicides, and GMO’s. 

We got the privilege of tasting the Pineapple Ginger, Spirulina Ginger,  Hibiscus Lemongrass, and finally our favorite, the Baobob Turmeric. Some of the superfoods used in Jajja Wellness Tonics include turmeric, a well known anti-inflammatory food. Baobob, a more common superfood outside of the US that, [according to Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/baobab#section2), is rich in many vitamins and minerals such zinc and potassium, has a high fiber content, and may help balance blood sugar levels. Spirulina is another superfood that is, “a highly absorbable source of protein and essential amino acids, iron, beta carotene, minerals, and other healthful vitamins including B-Vitamins and phycocyanin, a pigment protein antioxidant complex found only in blue-green microalgae”, [according to cyanotech Hawaii](https://www.cyanotech.com/spirulina/), the lead grower of pure Spirulina in the world. [Ginger is known](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-proven-benefits-of-ginger) for its ability to ease pain of digestion, flu like symptoms, and inflammation while potentially preventing cancer and reducing alzheimers. Some of the other superfood ingredients you can find in Jajja Wellness Tonics include Moringa, Lemongrass, Hibiscus, Pineapple, etc. We recommend doing your research on all of these superfood ingredients to find which might fit into your daily routine best!
