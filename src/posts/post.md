Local Demo Service is proud to welcome you to the launch of the Local Demo Service website and blog!

We believe that sustainable eating is the key to a healthy humanity! We support local, Organic, recycled, charity based, healthy, and/or other sustainably focused products to build a more sustainable and forward thinking food economy.

The purpose of this blog and website will be to increase our outreach as a company, and to educate our followers. Please feel free to browse our site and review monthly blog posts with research on food and sustainability; plus tips and tricks to increase your ability to make sales for your health food brand!



Thank you for your continued support!
